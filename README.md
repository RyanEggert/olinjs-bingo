# olinjs-bingo
Final project for olin.js spring 2015.

Our goal is to promote the game of buzzword bingo, [as featured in the Dilbert comic strip](http://dilbert.com/strip/1994-02-22). More specifically, we want to encourage playing bingo with people who aren't in the same room, like for nation-wide or world-wide events, such as the State of the Union, Oscars, or the Super Bowl.

Our online bingo extravaganza features:
- Custom text-based bingo games (Create your own!)
- Mobile friendly client (Play it anywhere!)
- Environment friendly (Save paper!)
